- **`ssl/`**: Contains the SSL certificate (`cert.pem`) and key (`key.pem`) -- These are generated by the `server.py` script if they do not exist.
- **`client.py`**: asyncio-based client.
- **`openssl.cnf`**: Configuration file for OpenSSL, used during the generation of the SSL certificate.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of all the dependencies required for the project.
- **`server.py`**: Server code that handles client connections, issues JWT tokens, and verifies them.
